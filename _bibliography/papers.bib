title = {A directional regularization method for the limited-angle Helsinki Tomography Challenge using the Core Imaging Library (CIL)},
year = {2023},
abstract = {This article presents the algorithms developed by the Core Imaging Library (CIL) developer
team for the Helsinki Tomography Challenge 2022. The challenge focused on reconstructing 2D
phantom shapes from limited-angle computed tomography (CT) data. The CIL team designed and
implemented five reconstruction methods using CIL (https://ccpi.ac.uk/cil/), an open-source
Python package for tomographic imaging. The CIL team adopted a model-based reconstruction
strategy, unique to this challenge with all other teams relying on deep-learning techniques. The
CIL algorithms showcased exceptional performance, with one algorithm securing the third place
in the competition. The best-performing algorithm employed careful CT data pre-processing and
an optimization problem with single-sided directional total variation regularization combined with
isotropic total variation and tailored lower and upper bounds. The reconstructions and segmentations achieved high quality for data with angular ranges down to 50 degrees, and in some cases
acceptable performance even at 40 and 30 degrees. This study highlights the effectiveness of modelbased approaches in limited-angle tomography and emphasizes the importance of proper algorithmic
design leveraging on available prior knowledge to overcome data limitations. Finally, this study
highlights the flexibility of CIL for prototyping and comparison of different optimization methods.},

title = {{Anatomically-guided deconvolution of PET using directional total variation regularization}},
year = {2023},
abstract = {{Positron emission tomography (PET) provides quantitative functional
imaging of biomarkers unavailable in other modalities, however, images are of
relatively low resolution compared to modalities such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). A typical approach is to reconstruct to a higher resolution and
regularize using a structural image, but there are practical limitations to this
approach. Alternatively, post-reconstruction approaches involve image-based
correction, but typically rely on a segmentation which may be difficult or even
ambiguous to find, depending on the anatomical region or deformities.
Here, we perform super-resolution by utilising iterative deconvolution,
regularized by minimizing shared directional total variation (dTV) with an
anatomical MRI image. We present results on synthetic and clinical data. For
the former, PET acquisitions were simulated using an analytic PET simulation.
The Gaussian blurring model parameters for deconvolution were optimized on a
simplistic phantom simulation with a total variation prior. This model was then
applied to deconvolve realistic synthetic data using dTV, which was
synthesized to include PET-unique lesions. The model was also applied to a
single 18F-florbetaben study acquired over 10 minutes.
Gray matter-white matter contrast increased using dTV compared with baseline,
however, where an accurate segmentation is available, traditional partial
volume correction techniques are superior. Hence, dTV-regularised
deconvolution can perform PVC and super-resolution in situations where a
reliable segmentation cannot be achieved. With appropriate hyper-parameter
selection, dTV deconvolution can preserve PET-unique features.}},

            spatio-temporally dependent regularization parameter-maps for variational image 
            reconstruction, focusing on total variation (TV)-minimization. 
            Our approach is inspired by recent developments in algorithm unrolling using 
            deep neural networks (NNs), and relies on two distinct sub-networks. T
            he first sub-network estimates the regularization parameter-map from the input data. 
            The second sub-network unrolls T iterations of an iterative algorithm which approximately 
            solves the corresponding TV-minimization problem incorporating the previously estimated 
            regularization parameter-map. The overall network is trained end-to-end in a supervised 
            learning fashion using pairs of clean-corrupted data but crucially without the need of 
            having access to labels for the optimal regularization parameter-maps. 
            We prove consistency of the unrolled scheme by showing that the unrolled energy functional used for the supervised learning Γ-converges as T 
            tends to infinity, to the corresponding functional that incorporates the exact solution map 
            of the TV-minimization problem. We apply and evaluate our method on a variety of large scale and dynamic imaging problems 
            in which the automatic computation of such parameters has been so far challenging: 2D dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction, 
            quantitative brain MRI reconstruction, low-dose CT and dynamic image denoising. The proposed method consistently improves 
            the TV-reconstructions using scalar parameters and the obtained parameter-maps adapt well to each imaging problem and data by 
            leading to the preservation of detailed features. Although the choice of the regularization parameter-maps is data-driven and based on NNs, the proposed algorithm is entirely interpretable since it inherits the properties of the respective iterative reconstruction method from which the network is implicitly defined.}},

	abstract = {Time-of-flight (ToF) neutron imaging offers complementary attenuation contrast to x-ray computed tomography, coupled with the ability to extract additional information from the variation in attenuation as a function of neutron energy (ToF) at every point (voxel) in the image. In particular, Bragg edge positions provide crystallographic information and therefore enable the identification of crystalline phases directly. Here we demonstrate Bragg edge tomography with high spatial and spectral resolution. We propose a new iterative tomographic reconstruction method with a tailored regularisation term to achieve high quality reconstruction from low-count data, where conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) fails. The regularisation acts in a separated mode for spatial and spectral dimensions and favours characteristic piece-wise constant and piece-wise smooth behaviour in the respective dimensions. The proposed method is compared against FBP and a state-of-the-art regulariser for multi-channel tomography on a multi-material phantom. The proposed new regulariser which accommodates specific image properties outperforms both conventional and state-of-the-art methods and therefore facilitates Bragg edge fitting at the voxel level. The proposed method requires significantly shorter exposures to retrieve features of interest. This in turn facilitates more efficient usage of expensive neutron beamline time and enables the full utilisation of state-of-the-art high resolution detectors.},

  journal = {Nature Scientific Reports},
  abstract = {{Here we apply hyperspectral bright field imaging to collect computed tomographic images with excellent energy resolution (~ 1 keV), applying it for the first time to map the distribution of stain in a fixed biological sample through its characteristic K-edge. Conventionally, because the photons detected at each pixel are distributed across as many as 200 energy channels, energy-selective images are characterised by low count-rates and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This means high X-ray exposures, long scan times and high doses are required to image unique spectral markers. Here, we achieve high quality energy-dispersive tomograms from low dose, noisy datasets using a dedicated iterative reconstruction algorithm. This exploits the spatial smoothness and inter-channel structural correlation in the spectral domain using two carefully chosen regularisation terms. For a multi-phase phantom, a reduction in scan time of 36 times is demonstrated. Spectral analysis methods including K-edge subtraction and absorption step-size fitting are evaluated for an ex vivo, single (iodine)-stained biological sample, where low chemical concentration and inhomogeneous distribution can affect soft tissue segmentation and visualisation. The reconstruction algorithms are available through the open-source Core Imaging Library. Taken together, these tools offer new capabilities for visualisation and elemental mapping, with promising applications for multiply-stained biological specimens.}},
