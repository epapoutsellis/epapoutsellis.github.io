CIL team organised a training and a [**Bring Your Own Data User Hackathon**](https://ccpi.ac.uk/events/byod-cil-hackathon/) in Cambridge. Many participants attended with very interesting applications and datasets. Our CIL hackers will upload their work in [CIL-User-Showcase](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL-User-Showcase).
