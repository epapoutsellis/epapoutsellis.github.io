My name is Evangelos (or Vaggelis) Papoutsellis. I am a Senior Research Scientist in [Finden Ltd](https://www.finden.co.uk/) and a Visitor Research Associate in the [Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester (UoM)](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/). I am also one of the main developers of the [Core Imaging Library (CIL)](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL) of the [Collaborative Computaional Project for Tomographic Imaging (CCPi)](https://ccpi.ac.uk/).

Prior to this, I was a Computational Imaging Scientist (permanent) at the [Scientific Computing Department (SCD)](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) in the [Science Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://stfc.ukri.org/). I obtained my PhD from the University of Cambridge, [Cambridge Image Analysis (CIA)](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis), [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP)](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) in 2016, under the supervision of Professor [Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb]({{ site.data.coauthors["Schönlieb"].url }}).

I completed my [Master of Advanced Study, Part III of Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html), University of Cambridge in 2011 and a 5 year Diploma in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences](http://semfe.ntua.gr/en/) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in 2010.
